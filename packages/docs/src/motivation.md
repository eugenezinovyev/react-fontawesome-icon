# Motivation

I regularly need Font Awesome SVG icon to be used in personal projects.
Unfortunately, existing [react-fontawesome](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-fontawesome) brings the whole [@fortawesome/font awesome-svg-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core) into my bundles.
It seems to happen because of the way @fortawesome/font awesome-svg-core package bundled.
